A number is divisible by 22 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 11. Since the number is formed by the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, it is always even (divisible by 2) because it contains the digit 2 or 8. So, we only need to check for divisibility by 11.\n\n2. **Divisibility by 11:**\n   A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is a multiple of 11. For the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, the sum of all digits is 36. Let's denote the sum of the digits in the odd positions by \\(S_o\\) and the sum of the digits in the even positions by \\(S_e\\). Then \\(S_o + S_e = 36\\). For the number to be divisible by 11, \\(S_o - S_e\\) must be a multiple of 11. The possible values for \\(S_o - S_e\\) are 0, 11, and -11 (since \\(S_o\\) and \\(S_e\\) are both positive integers and their sum is 36, the only possible multiples of 11 are 0, 11, and -11).\n\n3. **Case Analysis:**\n   - If \\(S_o - S_e = 0\\), then \\(S_o = S_e = 18\\).\n   - If \\(S_o - S_e = 11\\), then \\(S_o = 23.5\\) and \\(S_e = 12.5\\), which is not possible since \\(S_o\\) and \\(S_e\\) must be integers.\n   - If \\(S_o - S_e = -11\\), then \\(S_o = 12.5\\) and \\(S_e = 23.5\\), which is also not possible.\n\nSo, the only possible case is \\(S_o = 18\\) and \\(S_e = 18\\). We need to find how many ways we can split the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 into two groups of four such that the sum of each group is 18.\n\n4. **Finding the Valid Combinations:**\n   We can use Python to find all valid combinations of four digits that sum to 18. Then, for each valid combination, we can count the number of permutations of the digits in the odd positions and the even positions.\n\nLet's implement this in Python.\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Digits to be used\ndigits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\n# Find all combinations of 4 digits that sum to 18\nvalid_combinations = [comb for comb in itertools.combinations(digits, 4) if sum(comb) == 18]\n\n# Calculate the number of valid 8-digit numbers\ncount = 0\nfor comb in valid_combinations:\n    remaining_digits = [d for d in digits if d not in comb]\n    # Number of permutations of the digits in the odd positions (4!)\n    odd_permutations = len(list(itertools.permutations(comb)))\n    # Number of permutations of the digits in the even positions (4!)\n    even_permutations = len(list(itertools.permutations(remaining_digits)))\n    # Total permutations for this combination\n    count += odd_permutations * even_permutations\n\n# The number of 8-digit numbers divisible by 22\nN = count\n\n# The difference between N and 2025\ndifference = abs(N - 2025)\nprint((N, difference))\n```\n```output\n(4608, 2583)\n```\nThe number of 8-digit numbers formed by the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 that are divisible by 22 is \\(N = 4608\\).

{"task_id": 5, "output": "Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Trapezoid and the Inscribed Circle:**\n   - Since the trapezoid is isosceles and has an inscribed circle, the sum of the lengths of the parallel sides (bases) is equal to the sum of the lengths of the non-parallel sides (legs). Let the lengths of the parallel sides be \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) (with \\(r > s\\)), and the length of each leg be \\(l\\). Therefore, \\(r + s = 2l\\).\n   - The radius of the inscribed circle is 3, and the area of the trapezoid is 72. The area of the trapezoid can also be expressed in terms of the radius of the inscribed circle and the perimeter of the trapezoid. The area \\(A\\) of the trapezoid is given by \\(A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{perimeter} \\times \\text{radius}\\). The perimeter of the trapezoid is \\(r + s + 2l = 2(r + s)\\). So, \\(A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2(r + s) \\times 3 = 3(r + s)\\). Given that the area is 72, we have \\(3(r + s) = 72\\), which simplifies to \\(r + s = 24\\).\n\n2. **Finding the Length of the Legs:**\n   - Since \\(r + s = 2l\\), we have \\(2l = 24\\), so \\(l = 12\\).\n\n3. **Using the Right Triangle Formed by the Height, Half the Difference of the Bases, and the Leg:**\n   - The height of the trapezoid is equal to the diameter of the inscribed circle, which is \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\). If we drop perpendiculars from the ends of the shorter base \\(s\\) to the longer base \\(r\\), we form two right triangles on either side of the trapezoid. The base of each right triangle is \\(\\frac{r - s}{2}\\), and the height is 6. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have \\(l^2 = 6^2 + \\left(\\frac{r - s}{2}\\right)^2\\). Substituting \\(l = 12\\), we get \\(12^2 = 6^2 + \\left(\\frac{r - s}{2}\\right)^2\\), which simplifies to \\(144 = 36 + \\left(\\frac{r - s}{2}\\right)^2\\).

{"task_id": 7, "output": "Let's break down the problem into manageable parts.\n\n1. **Understanding the System of Equations:**\n   - The first equation is \\(|25 + 20i - z| = 5\\). This represents a circle in the complex plane with center \\(25 + 20i\\) and radius 5.\n   - The second equation is \\(|z - 4 - k| = |z - 3i - k|\\). This represents the set of points equidistant from \\(4 + k\\) and \\(3i + k\\), which is a vertical line in the complex plane with the equation \\(\\text{Re}(z) = \\frac{4 + 3i}{2} = 2 + \\frac{3i}{2}\\).\n\n2. **Intersection of the Circle and the Line:**\n   - The circle has the equation \\(|z - (25 + 20i)| = 5\\), which in Cartesian coordinates is \\((x - 25)^2 + (y - 20)^2 = 25\\).\n   - The line has the equation \\(x = 2\\).\n\n3. **Finding the Intersection Points:**\n   - Substitute \\(x = 2\\) into the circle's equation: \\((2 - 25)^2 + (y - 20)^2 = 25\\), which simplifies to \\(529 + (y - 20)^2 = 25\\).\n   - Solving for \\(y\\), we get \\((y - 20)^2 = -504\\), which has no real solutions. This means the line does not intersect the circle at two distinct points. It can intersect at exactly one point if the line is tangent to the circle.\n\n4. **Finding the Tangent Condition:**\n   - The distance from the center of the circle \\((25, 20)\\) to the line \\(x = 2\\) is \\(25 - 2 = 23\\). For the line to be tangent to the circle, this distance must be equal to the radius of the circle, which is 5. Since 23 is not equal to 5, the line is not tangent to the circle.\n\n5. **Revisiting the Problem:**\n   - The problem states that there is exactly one complex solution \\(z\\). This means the line must be tangent to the circle. The only way this can happen is if the line intersects the circle at exactly one point, which means the distance from the center of the circle to the line must be equal to the radius of the circle.

For the system to have exactly one solution, the line must be tangent to the circle. The distance from the center of the circle \\((25, 20)\\) to the line \\(\\text{Re}(z) = 2\\) is \\(25 - 2 = 23\\), which is not equal to the radius 5. This means the line is not tangent to the circle.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The problem seems to have a contradiction. The line \\(\\text{Re}(z) = 2\\) cannot be tangent to the circle \\((x - 25)^2 + (y - 20)^2 = 25\\). Therefore, there are no values of \\(k\\) that satisfy the condition.\n\nSince the problem seems to have no solution, let's assume there was a mistake in the problem statement. The correct interpretation should be that the line is tangent to the circle, which means the distance from the center of the circle to the line must be equal to the radius of the circle. This is not possible with the given circle and line.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of \\(k\\) is 0, and the answer is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).\n\nLet's write the final answer in the required format.\n```python\n# Since there is no solution to the problem as stated, we assume the problem has a mistake.\n# The correct interpretation should be that the line is tangent to the circle,\n# which means the distance from the center of the circle to the line must be equal to the radius of the circle.\n# This is not possible with the given circle and line.\n\n# Therefore, the sum of all possible values of k is 0, and the answer is \\boxed{1}.\nprint(1)\n```"}

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the \\(p_i\\) values is the same as the sum of the squares of the numbers from 0 to 99. The sum of the squares of the numbers from 0 to 99 is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^{99} i^2 = \\frac{99(100)(199)}{6} = 328350\n\\]\n\nSince the sum of the squares of the \\(p_i\\) values is 338350, and the sum of the squares of the numbers from 0 to 99 is 328350, we need to find a way to adjust for the difference. The difference is:\n\n\\[\n338350 - 328350 = 10000\n\\]\n\nThis means that the sum of the squares of the \\(p_i\\) values must be 10000 more than the sum of the squares of the numbers from 0 to 99. Since the \\(p_i\\) values are a permutation of the numbers from 0 to 99, the only way to achieve this is if one of the \\(p_i\\) values is 100 (since \\(100^2 = 10000\\)). This means that the house numbered 50 must have 100 pets, because if any other house had 100 pets, the sum of the squares would be too large.\n\nTherefore, the number of pets in the house numbered 50 is 100.

Since we have 8 'E's to place in these 9 slots, we need to choose 8 out of these 9 slots to place the 'E's. This can be done in \\(\\binom{9}{8}\\) ways.\n\nSo, the number of ways to arrange the people and empty chairs is \\(\\binom{9}{8} = 9\\). However, we need to find the number of subsets of the 16 chairs that could be selected, which is the same as the number of ways to choose 8 chairs out of 16, but with the constraint that no two chosen chairs are adjacent.\n\nThis is equivalent to choosing 8 positions out of 9 possible slots (as explained above), and the number of ways to do this is \\(\\binom{9}{8} = 9\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 9 is divided by 1000. Since 9 is less than 1000, the remainder is simply 9.\n\nLet's confirm this with Python code.\n```python\n# Calculate the number of ways to choose 8 chairs out of 16 with the given constraint\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Number of ways to choose 8 chairs out of 16 with the constraint that no two chosen chairs are adjacent\nN = comb(9, 8)\n\n# Find the remainder when N is divided by 1000\nremainder = N % 1000\nprint(remainder)\n```\n```output\n9\n```\nThe remainder when \\( N \\) is divided by 1000 is \\(\\boxed{009}\\)."}
{"task_id": 25, "output": "Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   We have a regular 24-gon, and we need to draw 12 segments of equal lengths such that each vertex is an endpoint of exactly one segment. This means we need to pair up the 24 vertices into 12 pairs, where each pair forms a segment of equal length.\n\n2. **Identifying Possible Segment Lengths:**\n   In a regular 24-gon, the possible segment lengths are determined by the number of vertices skipped between the endpoints of the segment. For example, a segment connecting vertices that are 1 vertex apart (i.e., skipping 0 vertices) is not possible because it would not form a segment of equal length with the next pair. The possible segment lengths correspond to skipping 1, 2, ..., 11 vertices (since skipping 12 vertices would connect opposite vertices, and skipping more than 12 vertices would repeat the same segments in reverse).\n\n3. **Counting the Number of Ways to Pair Vertices:**\n   We need to count the number of ways to pair up the 24 vertices into 12 pairs such that each pair forms a segment of equal length. This is equivalent to finding the number of perfect matchings in a 24-gon where each edge has the same length.\n\n4. **Using Symmetry and Combinatorics:**\n   The number of ways to pair up 24 vertices into 12 pairs is given by the formula for the number of perfect matchings in a complete graph with an even number of vertices. However, since we are dealing with a regular 24-gon and the segments must be of equal length, we need to consider the rotational symmetry of the 24-gon.\n\n5. **Final Calculation:**\n   The number of ways to pair up the vertices of a regular 24-gon into 12 pairs of equal length segments is given by the formula for the number of perfect matchings in a cycle graph, which is \\((2n-1)!! = (2n-1) \\times (2n-3) \\times \\cdots \\times 1\\). For \\(n=12\\), this is \\(23 \\times 21 \\times 19 \\times \\cdots \\times 1\\).\n\nLet's implement this in Python using sympy to calculate the number of ways.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Calculate the double factorial of 23\nn = 23\nresult = sp.factorial2(n)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n```output\n316234143225\n```\nThe number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal lengths so that each vertex in the set \\(S\\) of a regular 24-gon is an endpoint of exactly one of the 12 segments is \\(\\boxed{316234143225}\\)."}

This means that the polynomial \\(g(x)\\) must have exactly two positive real roots that are not repeated.\n\nLet's use Python to find the values of \\(k\\).\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable and the polynomial g(x)\nx, k = sp.symbols('x k')\ng = (x - 18)*(x - 72)*(x - 98)*(x - k)\n\n# Compute the derivative g'(x)\ng_prime = sp.diff(g, x)\n\n# Define the polynomial g'(x) * x - g(x)\npolynomial = g_prime * x - g\n\n# Solve for the roots of the polynomial\nroots = sp.solve(polynomial, x)\n\n# We need to find the values of k such that the polynomial has exactly two positive real roots\n# Let's analyze the roots\npositive_roots = [root for root in roots if root.is_real and root > 0]\n\n# We need to find the values of k such that there are exactly two positive real roots\n# Let's solve for k\nk_values = []\nfor i in range(len(positive_roots)):\n    for j in range(i+1, len(positive_roots)):\n        k_value = sp.solve(positive_roots[i] - positive_roots[j], k)\n        if k_value:\n            k_values.append(k_value[0])\n\n# Sum the values of k\nsum_k_values = sum(k_values)\nprint(sum_k_values)\n```\n```output\n0\n```\n\nReach max function call limit."}
