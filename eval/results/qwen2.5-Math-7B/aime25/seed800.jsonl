Convert the numbers $17_b$ and $97_b$ from base $b$ to base 10.\n2. Check the condition that $17_b$ divides $97_b$ in base 10.\n3. Find all integer bases $b > 9$ that satisfy the condition and sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's convert $17_b$ and $97_b$ to base 10. The number $17_b$ in base $b$ is $1 \\cdot b + 7 = b + 7$ in base 10. The number $97_b$ in base $b$ is $9 \\cdot b + 7 = 9b + 7$ in base 10.\n\nNext, we need to check the condition that $17_b$ divides $97_b$ in base 10. This means that $b + 7$ must divide $9b + 7$ without leaving a remainder. In other words, there must be an integer $k$ such that $9b + 7 = k(b + 7)$. Rearranging this equation, we get:\n\\[9b + 7 = k(b + 7) \\implies 9b + 7 = kb + 7k \\implies 9b - kb = 7k - 7 \\implies b(9 - k) = 7(k - 1).\\]\nThis equation must hold for some integer $k$. We can solve for $b$:\n\\[b = \\frac{7(k - 1)}{9 - k}.\\]\nFor $b$ to be an integer, $\\frac{7(k - 1)}{9 - k}$ must be an integer. This means that $9 - k$ must divide $7(k - 1)$. Let's find the values of $k$ that satisfy this condition and then find the corresponding values of $b$. We need $b > 9$.\n\nWe can write a Python code to check for all possible values of $k$ and find the corresponding values of $b$.\n\n```python\ndef find_valid_bases():\n    valid_bases = []\n    for k in range(1, 10):  # k must be less than 9 because 9 - k must be positive\n        if (7 * (k - 1)) % (9 - k) == 0:\n            b = (7 * (k - 1)) // (9 - k)\n            if b > 9:\n                valid_bases.append(b)\n    return valid_bases\n\nvalid_bases = find_valid_bases()\nsum_of_bases = sum(valid_bases)\nprint((valid_bases, sum_of_bases))\n```\n```output\n([], 0)\n```\nIt seems that the initial range for $k$ might not have been sufficient or there might be an issue with the logic. Let's re-evaluate the possible values for $k$ and ensure that we cover all possible cases.\n\nThe equation we derived is:\n\\[ b = \\frac{7(k - 1)}{9 - k}. \\]\nFor $b$ to be an integer, $9 - k$ must divide $7(k - 1)$. We need to check all possible values of $k$ such that $9 - k$ is a divisor of $7(k - 1)$. Since $b > 9$, we need to ensure that the resulting $b$ is greater than 9.\n\nLet's recheck the possible values of $k$ and ensure that we cover all possible cases. We'll also extend the range of $k$ to ensure we don't miss any possible values.\n\n```python\ndef find_valid_bases():\n    valid_bases = []\n    for k in range(1, 100):  # Extending the range for k to ensure we cover all possible cases\n        if (7 * (k - 1)) % (9 - k) == 0:\n            b = (7 * (k - 1)) // (9 - k)\n            if b > 9:\n                valid_bases.append(b)\n    return valid_bases\n\nvalid_bases = find_valid_bases()\nsum_of_bases = sum(valid_bases)\nprint((valid_bases, sum_of_bases))\n```\n```output\n([], 0)\n```\nIt seems that the logic still isn't yielding any valid bases. Let's take a closer look at the equation:\n\\[ b = \\frac{7(k - 1)}{9 - k}. \\]\nFor $b$ to be an integer, $9 - k$ must divide $7(k - 1)$. We need to ensure that the resulting $b$ is greater than 9. Let's manually check the possible values of $k$ and see if we can identify any issues.\n\nWe need to check the values of $k$ such that $9 - k$ is a divisor of $7(k - 1)$. Let's list out the possible values of $k$ and check the corresponding values of $b$:\n\n1. If $k = 1$, then $9 - k = 8$ and $7(k - 1) = 0$, so $b = 0$, which is not greater than 9.\n2. If $k = 2$, then $9 - k = 7$ and $7(k - 1) = 7$, so $b = 1$, which is not greater than 9.\n3. If $k = 3$, then $9 - k = 6$ and $7(k - 1) = 14$, so $b = \\frac{14}{6}$, which is not an integer.\n4. If $k = 4$, then $9 - k = 5$ and $7(k - 1) = 21$, so $b = \\frac{21}{5}$, which is not an integer.\n5. If $k = 5$, then $9 - k = 4$ and $7(k - 1) = 28$, so $b = 7$, which is not greater than 9.\n6. If $k = 6$, then $9 - k = 3$ and $7(k - 1) = 35$, so $b = \\frac{35}{3}$, which is not an integer.\n7. If $k = 7$, then $9 - k = 2$ and $7(k - 1) = 42$, so $b = 21$, which is greater than 9.\n8. If $k = 8$, then $9 - k = 1$ and $7(k - 1) = 49$, so $b = 49$, which is greater than 9.\n9. If $k = 10$, then $9 - k = -1$ and $7(k - 1) = 63$, so $b = -63$, which is not greater than 9.\n\nFrom the above, we see that the valid values of $k$ that give $b > 9$ are $k = 7$ and $k = 8$. The corresponding values of $b$ are $21$ and $49$. The sum of these values is $21 + 49 = 70$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all integer bases $b > 9$ for which $17_{b}$ is a divisor of $97_{b}$ is $\\boxed{70}$."}

Find the value of the integral\n\\[I = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{\\cos^2(x)}{(a + b\\cos(x))^2} dx.\\]\nExpress your answer in terms of $a$ and $b$ using standard mathematical functions.\nTo solve the integral \\( I = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{\\cos^2(x)}{(a + b\\cos(x))^2} \\, dx \\), we can use a trigonometric substitution and symmetry properties. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Symmetry and Periodicity**: The integrand is periodic with period \\(2\\pi\\), and it is symmetric about \\(x = \\pi\\). Therefore, we can simplify the integral by considering the interval \\([0, \\pi]\\) and doubling the result:\n   \\[\n   I = 2 \\int_0^{\\pi} \\frac{\\cos^2(x)}{(a + b\\cos(x))^2} \\, dx.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Trigonometric Substitution**: We can use the substitution \\( t = \\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) \\). This substitution is useful because it transforms trigonometric functions into rational functions. The identities we need are:\n   \\[\n   \\cos(x) = \\frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2}, \\quad dx = \\frac{2 \\, dt}{1 + t^2}.\n   \\]\n   When \\( x = 0 \\), \\( t = 0 \\), and when \\( x = \\pi \\), \\( t = \\infty \\). So the integral becomes:\n   \\[\n   I = 2 \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2}\\right)^2}{\\left(a + b \\frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2}\\right)^2} \\frac{2 \\, dt}{1 + t^2}.\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the integrand, we get:\n   \\[\n   I = 4 \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(1 - t^2)^2}{(a(1 + t^2) + b(1 - t^2))^2 (1 + t^2)} \\, dt = 4 \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(1 - t^2)^2}{((a + b) + (a - b)t^2)^2 (1 + t^2)} \\, dt.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplifying the Integrand**: Let's simplify the denominator:\n   \\[\n   (a + b) + (a - b)t^2 = (a + b)(1 + \\frac{a - b}{a + b}t^2).\n   \\]\n   So the integral becomes:\n   \\[\n   I = 4 \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(1 - t^2)^2}{(a + b)^2 (1 + \\frac{a - b}{a + b}t^2)^2 (1 + t^2)} \\, dt.\n   \\]\n   Let \\( k = \\frac{a - b}{a + b} \\).

The roots are:\n\\[ z = \\frac{-2a \\pm \\sqrt{4a^2 - 4b^2}}{2b} = \\frac{-a \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}}{b}. \\]\n\nSince \\( a > b \\), the roots are real and distinct. The residue at \\( z = 0 \\) is:\n\\[ \\text{Res}(f, 0) = \\lim_{z \\to 0} z \\frac{(z^2 + 1)^2}{4z \\left(\\frac{bz^2 + 2az + b}{2z}\\right)^2} = \\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{(z^2 + 1)^2}{4 \\left(\\frac{bz^2 + 2az + b}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{4a^2}. \\]\n\nThe residues at the other poles are more complicated, but we can use the fact that the integral is real and symmetric to simplify the result. The integral is:\n\\[ I = \\frac{1}{2i} \\cdot 2\\pi i \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{4a^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2a^2}. \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of the integral is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{a^2 - b^2}}. \\]\n\nA high school math club is exploring the properties of matrices and their applications.

{"task_id": 5, "output": "We know that the area of the trapezoid is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(r + s)h$, where $h$ is the height of the trapezoid. Since the trapezoid is inscribed in a circle with radius $3$, the height of the trapezoid is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is $6$. Therefore, we have $72 = \\frac{1}{2}(r + s)6$, which simplifies to $r + s = 24$.\n\nWe also know that the trapezoid is isosceles, which means that the two non-parallel sides are equal in length. Let's call the length of these sides $t$. Since the trapezoid is inscribed in a circle, the two non-parallel sides are also chords of the circle. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector of the chord is also the radius of the circle, which is $3$. This means that the distance from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord is $3$.\n\nLet's call the midpoint of the chord $M$. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, $M$ is also the midpoint of the trapezoid. Let's call the distance from $M$ to the parallel side with length $r$ as $x$, and the distance from $M$ to the parallel side with length $s$ as $y$. Since $M$ is the midpoint of the trapezoid, we have $x + y = 6$.\n\nWe also know that the distance from the center of the circle to $M$ is $3$, and the distance from the center of the circle to the parallel side with length $r$ is $3 - x$, and the distance from the center of the circle to the parallel side with length $s$ is $3 - y$. Since the circle is tangent to the trapezoid, these distances are equal to the radius of the circle, which is $3$. Therefore, we have $3 - x = 3$ and $3 - y = 3$, which simplifies to $x = 0$ and $y = 6$.\n\nSince $x = 0$, we have $r = 2x = 0$. Since $y = 6$, we have $s = 2y = 12$. Therefore, $r^{2} + s^{2} = 0^{2} + 12^{2} = \\boxed{144}$.\n\n</think>\nThe answer is $\\boxed{144}$."}

The set of all positive integer divisors of 2025, $A$, can be described as all numbers of the form $3^a \\cdot 5^b$ where $0 \\leq a \\leq 4$ and $0 \\leq b \\leq 2$. This gives us a total of $(4+1)(2+1) = 15$ divisors. \n\nThe set $A$ is:\n\\[A = \\{1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 25, 27, 45, 75, 81, 135, 225, 405, 675, 2025\\}.\\]\n\nTo form a subset $B$ such that the LCM of its elements is 2025, we need to ensure that the highest power of 3 and 5 in the subset is $3^4$ and $5^2$ respectively. This means that the subset must include at least one element with $3^4$ and at least one element with $5^2$.\n\nThe number of ways to choose a subset $B$ that includes at least one element with $3^4$ and at least one element with $5^2$ can be calculated using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. \n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of subsets of $A$ that include at least one element with $3^4$. There are $2^{14}$ such subsets (since we can include or exclude each of the other 14 elements independently).\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of subsets of $A$ that include at least one element with $5^2$. There are $2^{14}$ such subsets.\n\nHowever, we have double-counted the subsets that include both $3^4$ and $5^2$. There are $2^{13}$ such subsets (since we can include or exclude each of the other 13 elements independently).\n\nSo, the number of subsets $B$ such that the LCM of its elements is 2025 is $2^{14} + 2^{14} - 2^{13} = 2^{13}(2 + 2 - 1) = 2^{14}$.\n\nThe total number of nonempty subsets of $A$ is $2^{15} - 1$. So, the probability that a randomly selected subset $B$ of $A$ satisfies the LCM condition is $\\frac{2^{14}}{2^{15} - 1} = \\frac{16384}{32767}$. \n\nSince 16384 and 32767 are relatively prime, we have $m = 16384$ and $n = 32767$. Therefore, $m + n = 16384 + 32767 = 49151$.\n\nFinally, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{49151}\n\\]"}

For each value of $k$, there are two solutions for $5x$ in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$, which gives us a total of $15$ solutions for $x$ in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$ (since there are $15$ possible values for $k$).\n\nHowever, we are only interested in the interval $0 < x < 2\\pi$.

One way to simplify the problem is to look at the behavior of the sequence in terms of its convergence.\n\nWe can hypothesize that the sequence might converge to a fixed point. Let's assume that the sequence converges to a limit $L$. Then, we have:\n\\[ L = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(L + \\frac{1}{L} - 1\\right). \\]\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n\\[ 3L = L + \\frac{1}{L} - 1. \\]\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\\[ 2L + 1 = \\frac{1}{L}. \\]\nMultiplying both sides by $L$, we get:\n\\[ 2L^2 + L - 1 = 0. \\]\nThis is a quadratic equation. Solving for $L$, we get:\n\\[ L = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8}}{4} = \\frac{-1 \\pm 3}{4}. \\]\nSo, the solutions are $L = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $L = -1$. Since the terms of the sequence are positive, the limit must be $L = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nGiven that the sequence converges to $\\frac{1}{2}$, we can hypothesize that $x_{2025} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}$.

{"task_id": 28, "output": "Given that $AK = AL = BK = CL = KL = 14$, we can see that $\\triangle AKL$ and $\\triangle BKL$ are equilateral triangles.

Then, $x^2 + y^2 = 38^2$.\n\nSince $\\triangle AKL$ and $\\triangle BKL$ are equilateral triangles, $KL = 14$ is the side length of these triangles. Therefore, $BK = CL = 14$. Since $BC = 38$, $BK + CL = 28$, which means $AB + AC = 28$. We can now solve the system of equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nx^2 + y^2 = 38^2 \\\\\nx + y = 28\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nSolving this system, we find $x = 14$ and $y = 14$.

The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 14 \\cdot 14 = 98$.\n\nThe area of $\\triangle AKL$ and $\\triangle BKL$ can be found using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, which is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. Therefore, the area of $\\triangle AKL$ and $\\triangle BKL$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot 14^2 = 49\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe area of the quadrilateral $BKLC$ is the area of $\\triangle ABC$ minus the area of $\\triangle AKL$ and $\\triangle BKL$, which is $98 - 2 \\cdot 49\\sqrt{3} = 98 - 98\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, $n = 98 - 98\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the area of the quadrilateral $BKLC$ to be expressed as $n\\sqrt{3}$ for some positive integer $n$. Therefore, we need to express $98 - 98\\sqrt{3}$ in the form $n\\sqrt{3}$. We can do this by factoring out $\\sqrt{3}$, which gives us $98\\sqrt{3} - 98\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{3} = 98\\sqrt{3} - 294 = -196\\sqrt{3} + 98\\sqrt{3} = -98\\sqrt{3}$.

Solving for $n$, we find $n = 98 - 98\\sqrt{3}/\\sqrt{3} = 98 - 98 = 0$. However, this is not a positive integer, so we need to find another way to express the area of the quadrilateral $BKLC$ in the form $n\\sqrt{3}$ for some positive integer $n$.\n\nWe can express the area of the quadrilateral $BKLC$ as $98 - 98\\sqrt{3} = 98(1 - \\sqrt{3})$.

{"task_id": 29, "output": "Step 1: Understanding the function\nThe function $f(x)$ is a rational function defined over the positive real numbers. It has four roots: $x = 18, 72, 98,$ and $k$. The function approaches infinity as $x$ approaches $0$ or $+\\infty$. The minimum value of $f(x)$ will occur at a critical point where $f'(x) = 0$ or at the boundary points of the domain. However, since $f(x)$ approaches infinity at the boundaries, the minimum value will occur at a critical point.\n\nStep 2: Finding the derivative\nTo find the critical points, we need to find the derivative of $f(x)$ and set it equal to zero. Using the quotient rule, we have:\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k)'}{x} - \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k)}{x^2}$$\nSimplifying the derivative, we get:\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(1) - (x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k)}{x^2}$$\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(1 - (x - k))}{x^2}$$\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(k - x)}{x^2}$$\n\nStep 3: Solving for critical points\nSetting $f'(x) = 0$, we have:\n$$\\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(k - x)}{x^2} = 0$$\nSince $x$ is positive, we can ignore the denominator. Thus, we have:\n$$(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(k - x) = 0$$\nThis equation has four roots: $x = 18, 72, 98,$ and $k$. However, since $f(x)$ approaches infinity at the boundaries, the minimum value will occur at a critical point where $f'(x) = 0$ and $f''(x) > 0$. We can check the second derivative to determine the nature of the critical points.\n\nStep 4: Checking the second derivative\nTo check the nature of the critical points, we need to find the second derivative of $f(x)$. Using the quotient rule again, we have:\n$$f''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(k - x)}{x^2}\\right)$$\nSimplifying the second derivative, we get:\n$$f''(x) = \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(k - x)'}{x^2} - 2\\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(k - x)}{x^3}$$\n$$f''(x) = \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(-1)}{x^2} - 2\\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(k - x)}{x^3}$$\n$$f''(x) = \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(-1 - 2(k - x))}{x^3}$$\n\nStep 5: Determining the nature of the critical points\nTo determine the nature of the critical points, we need to check the sign of $f''(x)$ at each critical point. If $f''(x) > 0$, then the critical point is a local minimum. If $f''(x) < 0$, then the critical point is a local maximum. If $f''(x) = 0$, then the critical point is a saddle point.\n\nAt $x = 18$, we have:\n$$f''(18) = \\frac{(18 - 18)(18 - 72)(18 - 98)(-1 - 2(k - 18))}{18^3} = 0$$\nAt $x = 72$, we have:\n$$f''(72) = \\frac{(72 - 18)(72 - 72)(72 - 98)(-1 - 2(k - 72))}{72^3} = 0$$\nAt $x = 98$, we have:\n$$f''(98) = \\frac{(98 - 18)(98 - 72)(98 - 98)(-1 - 2(k - 98))}{98^3} = 0$$\nAt $x = k$, we have:\n$$f''(k) = \\frac{(k - 18)(k - 72)(k - 98)(-1 - 2(k - k))}{k^3} = \\frac{(k - 18)(k - 72)(k - 98)}{k^3}$$\nFor $f''(k) > 0$, we need $(k - 18)(k - 72)(k - 98) > 0$. This inequality is satisfied when $k < 18$ or $72 < k < 98$. However, since $k$ is a positive real number, we only consider $k < 18$ or $72 < k < 98$.\n\nStep 6: Finding the sum of the three values of $k$\nThe three values of $k$ that satisfy the condition are $k < 18$ or $72 < k < 98$. Since we are asked to find the sum of these three values of $k$, we need to find the sum of all possible values of $k$ in these intervals. However, since the problem asks for the sum of the three values of $k$, we can assume that the three values are the endpoints of the intervals, i.e., $k = 18, 72,$ and $98$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the three values of $k$ is:\n$$k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = 18 + 72 + 98 = \\boxed{188}$$\n\n</think>\nThe answer is $\\boxed{188}$."}
