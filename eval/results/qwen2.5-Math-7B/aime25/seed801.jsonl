{"task_id": 4, "output": "The number of eight-digit positive integers that use each of the digits $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$ exactly once is $8!=40320$. To find the number of these integers that are divisible by 22, we need to check the divisibility by 2 and 11. The divisibility by 2 is easy to check, as the last digit must be even. The divisibility by 11 is more complex, and we need to check the alternating sum of the digits. The alternating sum of the digits of a number is the sum of the digits in the odd positions minus the sum of the digits in the even positions. For a number to be divisible by 11, the alternating sum must be divisible by 11. The sum of the digits $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$ is 36, which is even. Therefore, the alternating sum must be even and divisible by 11. The possible alternating sums are $-22, -11, 0, 11, 22$. We can use Python to count the number of permutations that satisfy these conditions.

{"task_id": 5, "output": "The area of an isosceles trapezoid with an inscribed circle can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ A = r \\times (a + b) / 2 \\]\nwhere $r$ is the radius of the inscribed circle, and $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the parallel sides. In this problem, the area $A$ is 72, and the radius $r$ is 3. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ 72 = 3 \\times (r + s) / 2 \\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[ 72 = 3 \\times (r + s) / 2 \\]\n\\[ 48 = r + s \\]\nNext, we need to find $r^2 + s^2$. We can use the identity:\n\\[ (r + s)^2 = r^2 + s^2 + 2rs \\]\nWe already know that $r + s = 48$, so:\n\\[ 48^2 = r^2 + s^2 + 2rs \\]\n\\[ 2304 = r^2 + s^2 + 2rs \\]\nTo find $rs$, we use the fact that the trapezoid has an inscribed circle. The height of the trapezoid is equal to the diameter of the inscribed circle, which is $2 \\times 3 = 6$. The height of the trapezoid is also the altitude of the two right triangles formed by dropping perpendiculars from the endpoints of the shorter base to the longer base. The legs of these right triangles are the same as the lengths of the legs of the isosceles trapezoid minus half the difference of the bases. The right triangles formed have a height of 6, and the legs are equal to $\\sqrt{6^2 + \\left(\\frac{s-r}{2}\\right)^2}$. The sum of the lengths of the legs of these triangles is equal to the length of the non-parallel sides of the trapezoid. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the legs of the right triangles are equal, and the sum of the lengths of the legs is equal to the length of the non-parallel sides.

{"task_id": 7, "output": "Let's break down the problem step-by-step and solve it using Python and sympy.\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - The first equation \\( |25 + 20i - z| = 5 \\) represents a circle in the complex plane centered at \\( 25 + 20i \\) with a radius of 5.\n   - The second equation \\( |z - 4 - k| = |z - 3i - k| \\) represents the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining the points \\( 4 + k \\) and \\( 3i + k \\) in the complex plane.\n\n2. **Find the Equation of the Perpendicular Bisector:**\n   - The midpoint of the line segment joining \\( 4 + k \\) and \\( 3i + k \\) is \\( \\frac{(4 + k) + (3i + k)}{2} = 2 + \\frac{3i}{2} + k \\).\n   - The slope of the line segment joining \\( 4 + k \\) and \\( 3i + k \\) is the slope of the imaginary axis, which is undefined (vertical line). Therefore, the perpendicular bisector is a horizontal line passing through the midpoint, so the equation of the perpendicular bisector is \\( \\text{Im}(z) = \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Intersection of the Circle and the Line:**\n   - The circle is centered at \\( 25 + 20i \\) with radius 5, so its equation in the complex plane is \\( |z - (25 + 20i)| = 5 \\).\n   - The line is \\( \\text{Im}(z) = \\frac{3}{2} \\). Substituting \\( z = x + yi \\) into the circle's equation, we get \\( |(x + yi) - (25 + 20i)| = 5 \\), which simplifies to \\( \\sqrt{(x - 25)^2 + (y - 20)^2} = 5 \\).\n   - Since \\( y = \\frac{3}{2} \\), we substitute \\( y = \\frac{3}{2} \\) into the circle's equation: \\( \\sqrt{(x - 25)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{2} - 20\\right)^2} = 5 \\). This simplifies to \\( \\sqrt{(x - 25)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{37}{2}\\right)^2} = 5 \\), or \\( (x - 25)^2 + \\left(\\frac{37}{2}\\right)^2 = 25 \\).\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Simplifying the equation, we get \\( (x - 25)^2 + \\frac{1369}{4} = 25 \\), or \\( (x - 25)^2 = 25 - \\frac{1369}{4} = \\frac{100}{4} - \\frac{1369}{4} = -\\frac{1269}{4} \\).

This happens when the distance from the center of the circle to the line is equal to the radius of the circle.\n\n5. **Find the Distance from the Center to the Line:**\n   - The distance from the center \\( 25 + 20i \\) to the line \\( \\text{Im}(z) = \\frac{3}{2} \\) is the vertical distance, which is \\( |20 - \\frac{3}{2}| = \\frac{37}{2} \\).

However, since \\( \\frac{37}{2} \\neq 5 \\), we need to adjust the radius of the circle such that the distance from the center to the line is equal to the radius.\n\n6. **Adjust the Radius:**\n   - The radius must be \\( \\frac{37}{2} \\) for the line to intersect the circle at exactly one point. However, the problem states that the radius is 5.

Let's try a different approach by simplifying the problem and using geometric properties to find the minimum value of \\(f(X)\\).\n\nGiven the symmetry and the specific angles, the point \\(X\\) that minimizes \\(f(X)\\) is likely to be the Fermat point of the pentagon. For a convex pentagon with given side lengths and angles, the Fermat point is the point that minimizes the sum of distances to the vertices.\n\nWe can use the fact that the minimum value of \\(f(X)\\) is the sum of the distances from \\(X\\) to the vertices of the pentagon.

Since $a,b,c\\leq3^6$, we have $a^3,b^3,c^3\\leq3^{18}$. The possible remainders when a number is divided by $3^7$ are $0, 1, 2, \\dots, 3^6-1$. \n\nLet's consider the case where $a^3+b^3+c^3$ is a multiple of $3^7$. This means that the sum of the remainders of $a^3$, $b^3$, and $c^3$ when divided by $3^7$ is a multiple of $3^7$. \n\nWe can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ that satisfy this condition. Let $A$ be the set of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ such that $a^3$ is a multiple of $3^7$. Let $B$ be the set of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ such that $b^3$ is a multiple of $3^7$. Let $C$ be the set of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ such that $c^3$ is a multiple of $3^7$. We want to count the number of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ that are in $A\\cup B\\cup C$.\n\nBy the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have:\n$|A\\cup B\\cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\\cap B| - |A\\cap C| - |B\\cap C| + |A\\cap B\\cap C|$\n\nWe can calculate each of these terms as follows:\n$|A| = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{3^6}{3^7}\\right\\rfloor^3 = 0^3 = 0$\n$|B| = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{3^6}{3^7}\\right\\rfloor^3 = 0^3 = 0$\n$|C| = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{3^6}{3^7}\\right\\rfloor^3 = 0^3 = 0$\n$|A\\cap B| = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{3^6}{3^7}\\right\\rfloor^2 = 0^2 = 0$\n$|A\\cap C| = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{3^6}{3^7}\\right\\rfloor^2 = 0^2 = 0$\n$|B\\cap C| = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{3^6}{3^7}\\right\\rfloor^2 = 0^2 = 0$\n$|A\\cap B\\cap C| = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{3^6}{3^7}\\right\\rfloor = 0$\n\nTherefore, we have:\n$|A\\cup B\\cup C| = 0 + 0 + 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 + 0 = 0$\n\nThis means that there are no ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ such that $a,b,c\\leq3^6$ and $a^3+b^3+c^3$ is a multiple of $3^7$.\n\nHowever, this is not the case. We made an error in our calculation. The error is that we assumed that $a^3$, $b^3$, and $c^3$ are all multiples of $3^7$. This is not necessarily true. We need to consider the case where $a^3$, $b^3$, and $c^3$ are not all multiples of $3^7$.\n\nLet's consider the case where $a^3$, $b^3$, and $c^3$ are not all multiples of $3^7$. In this case, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the number of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ such that $a^3+b^3+c^3$ is a multiple of $3^7$. The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that if we have a system of congruences of the form:\n$x\\equiv a_1\\pmod{m_1}$\n$x\\equiv a_2\\pmod{m_2}$\n$\\vdots$\n$x\\equiv a_k\\pmod{m_k}$\n\nwhere $m_1,m_2,\\dots,m_k$ are pairwise coprime, then there exists a unique solution modulo $m_1m_2\\dotsm_k$.\n\nIn our case, we have the system of congruences:\n$a^3\\equiv 0\\pmod{3^7}$\n$b^3\\equiv 0\\pmod{3^7}$\n$c^3\\equiv 0\\pmod{3^7}$\n\nwhere $3^7$ is a power of a prime. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists a unique solution modulo $3^{21}$.\n\nWe can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the number of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ such that $a^3+b^3+c^3$ is a multiple of $3^7$. We can do this by finding the number of solutions to the system of congruences:\n$a^3\\equiv 0\\pmod{3^7}$\n$b^3\\equiv 0\\pmod{3^7}$\n$c^3\\equiv 0\\pmod{3^7}$\n\nmodulo $3^{21}$.\n\nWe can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the number of solutions to this system of congruences. The number of solutions is equal to the product of the number of solutions to each congruence.\n\nThe number of solutions to the congruence $a^3\\equiv 0\\pmod{3^7}$ is equal to the number of solutions to the congruence $a\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$, which is equal to $3^6$. Similarly, the number of solutions to the congruence $b^3\\equiv 0\\pmod{3^7}$ is equal to $3^6$, and the number of solutions to the congruence $c^3\\equiv 0\\pmod{3^7}$ is equal to $3^6$.\n\nTherefore, the number of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ such that $a^3+b^3+c^3$ is a multiple of $3^7$ is equal to $3^6\\cdot3^6\\cdot3^6=3^{18}$.\n\nFinally, we need to find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Since $N=3^{18}$, we have:\n$N\\equiv 3^{18}\\pmod{1000}$\n\nWe can use the fact that $3^3\\equiv 27\\pmod{1000}$ to simplify this expression. We have:\n$3^{18}\\equiv (3^3)^6\\equiv 27^6\\pmod{1000}$\n\nWe can use the fact that $27^2\\equiv 729\\pmod{1000}$ to simplify this expression further. We have:\n$27^6\\equiv (27^2)^3\\equiv 729^3\\pmod{1000}$\n\nWe can use the fact that $729^2\\equiv 441\\pmod{1000}$ to simplify this expression further. We have:\n$729^3\\equiv (729^2)\\cdot729\\equiv 441\\cdot729\\pmod{1000}$\n\nWe can use the fact that $441\\cdot729\\equiv 641\\pmod{1000}$ to simplify this expression further. We have:\n$641\\equiv 641\\pmod{1000}$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{641}$."}

Let's reconsider the problem and simplify our approach.\n\nSince each unit square must have exactly 2 red sides and 2 blue sides, we can observe that the coloring must alternate around each square. This means that if we start with a red side on one side of a square, the opposite side must also be red, and the adjacent sides must be blue.\n\nLet's consider the \\(2 \\times 2\\) grid and label the sides as follows:\n- Top-left square: \\(a1, a2, b1, b2\\)\n- Top-right square: \\(b2, b3, c1, c2\\)\n- Bottom-left square: \\(a3, a4, d1, d2\\)\n- Bottom-right square: \\(d2, d3, c2, c3\\)\n\nWe can start by coloring the outer edges and then determine the valid configurations for the inner edges. Since the coloring must alternate, we can see that there are only two possible configurations for the outer edges: either the top and bottom edges are red and the left and right edges are blue, or the top and bottom edges are blue and the left and right edges are red.\n\nLet's consider the first configuration: top and bottom edges are red, and left and right edges are blue. This means:\n- \\(a1 = a3 = R\\)\n- \\(b1 = d1 = B\\)\n- \\(a2 = a4 = B\\)\n- \\(b2 = d2 = R\\)\n- \\(b3 = c1 = B\\)\n- \\(c2 = d3 = R\\)\n\nThis configuration ensures that each square has exactly 2 red sides and 2 blue sides. The same logic applies to the second configuration where the top and bottom edges are blue and the left and right edges are red.\n\nSince there are only two possible configurations for the outer edges, and each configuration uniquely determines the coloring of the inner edges, we have exactly 2 valid colorings.\n\nTherefore, the number of such colorings is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."}

Here, $a_1 = 1$ and $d = 2$, so the general term is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = 1 + (n-1) \\cdot 2 = 1 + 2(n-1) = 2n - 1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the 10th Term:**\n   To find $a_{10}$, we substitute $n = 10$ into the general term formula:\n   \\[\n   a_{10} = 2 \\cdot 10 - 1 = 20 - 1 = 19\n   \\]\n\nNow let's implement this in Python using sympy to verify our result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the first term and common difference\na1 = 1\nd = 2\n\n# Define the general term of the arithmetic sequence\nn = sp.symbols('n')\na_n = a1 + (n - 1) * d\n\n# Find the 10th term\na_10 = a_n.subs(n, 10)\nprint(a_10)\n```\n```output\n19\n```\nThe value of the 10th term in the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is $\\boxed{19}$."}
{"task_id": 28, "output": "Let's start by analyzing the given problem. We have a right triangle $\\triangle ABC$ with $\\angle A = 90^\\circ$ and $BC = 38$. There are points $K$ and $L$ inside the triangle such that $AK = AL = BK = CL = KL = 14$. We need to find the area of the quadrilateral $BKLC$ in the form $n\\sqrt{3}$ and determine the value of $n$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Identify the Coordinates of Points:**\n   - Place the right triangle in the coordinate plane with $A$ at the origin $(0, 0)$, $B$ at $(a, 0)$, and $C$ at $(0, b)$. Since $BC = 38$, we have the equation $a^2 + b^2 = 38^2 = 1444$.\n   - The points $K$ and $L$ are equidistant from $A$, $B$, and $C$, and form an equilateral triangle with side length 14. This implies that $K$ and $L$ are located at the intersection of the circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$ with radius 14.\n\n2. **Find the Coordinates of $K$ and $L$:**\n   - Since $AK = AL = 14$, $K$ and $L$ lie on the circle centered at $A$ with radius 14. Similarly, $K$ and $L$ lie on the circles centered at $B$ and $C$ with radius 14.\n   - The coordinates of $K$ and $L$ can be found by solving the system of equations representing these circles. However, we can use symmetry and geometric properties to find the area of the quadrilateral $BKLC$.\n\n3. **Calculate the Area of Quadrilateral $BKLC$:**\n   - The quadrilateral $BKLC$ can be divided into two triangles, $\\triangle BKL$ and $\\triangle CLK$. Since $BK = KL = CL = 14$, the triangles $\\triangle BKL$ and $\\triangle CLK$ are equilateral triangles with side length 14.\n   - The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$. Therefore, the area of each triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot 14^2 = 49\\sqrt{3}$.\n   - The total area of the quadrilateral $BKLC$ is the sum of the areas of $\\triangle BKL$ and $\\triangle CLK$, which is $49\\sqrt{3} + 49\\sqrt{3} = 98\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThus, the area of the quadrilateral $BKLC$ is $98\\sqrt{3}$, and the value of $n$ is 98.\n\nLet's confirm this with Python and sympy.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the side length of the equilateral triangles\nside_length = 14\n\n# Calculate the area of one equilateral triangle\narea_one_triangle = (sp.sqrt(3) / 4) * side_length**2\n\n# The total area of the quadrilateral BKLC is the sum of the areas of two equilateral triangles\ntotal_area = 2 * area_one_triangle\n\n# Extract the value of n\nn = total_area / sp.sqrt(3)\nprint(n)\n```\n```output\n98\n```\nThe value of \\( n \\) is \\(\\boxed{98}\\)."}
